<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)



<h2>Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Setup Resources in Azure</h3>

- Create two virtual machines
  - If you need help creating your virtual machines, please see my tutorial [here](https://github.com/miquelmanaois/virtualmachine)
    - 1st virtual machine will be the Domain Controller
       - Name: DC-1
       - Image: Windows Server 2022
       - Take note of the Virtual Network (Vnet) that gets created at this time
       - Set DC-1's virtual Network Interface Card (NIC) Private IP address to be static
           - Go to DC-1's network settings -> select networking -> select the link next to network interface -> IP Configurations -> ipconfig1 -> Assignment from dynamic to static (this ensures DC-1's IP address will not change)
    - 2nd virtual machine will be the Client
       - Name: Client-1
       - Image: Windows 10 Pro
       - Use the same resource group and Vnet as DC-1

</p>

<h3>Step 2: Ensure Connectivity between client and Domain Controller</h3>

- Login to Client-1 using Microsoft Remote Desktop
  - Search for command line and open it
  - ping DC-1's private IP Address
    - ping - t 822332229189838
      - Due to the firewall, the request is timing out. To fix this, we need to enable ICMPv4 on DC-1's local Windows firewall. 
- Login to DC-1 using Microsoft Remote Desktop
    - Start -> Windows Administrative Tools -> Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security -> Inbound rules.
    - Sort the list by protocols 
      - Find ICMPv4 and enable these two inbound rules.
- Log back into Client-1 and the Command line will start to ping DC-1 successfully.

</p>


<h3>Step 3:  Install Active Directory</h3>

- Log back ito DC-1 
    - Open Server Manager
    - Select "Add roles and features." Follow the prompts.
    - At Server Roles, check "Active Directory Domain Services." Then select next Add Features. Select next and finish installing.
    - At the top right of the Server Manager Dashboard, click on the flag. 
        - Select Promote this server to a domain controller.
            - Select Add a new forest
                - Root domain name: mydomain.com
            - Select next
                - Create password
            - Select next, follow the prompts and finish up by selecting install. 
                - DC-1 will automatically restart.
- Log back into DC-1 as user: mydomain.com\labuser

</p>


<h3>Step 4: Create an Admin and Normal User Account in Active Directory v1.15.8</h3>
     
- On DC-1, open up Server Manager
	- Click tools at the top right hand side
		- select Active Directory Users and Computers.
			- Right click mydomain.com -> New -> Select Oranizational Unit (We will be creating 2 folders.)
				- Name one _EMPLOYEES and the other _ADMINS
			- Right click mydomain.com and click referesh to sort the new organizational units to the top.
				- Go to _ADMINS organzational unit -> right click -> New -> User
					- First/Last name: jane doe
					- user login name: jane_admin
					- Select next and create a password 
						- uncheck all boxes, select next and then select finish
				- Go to _ADMINS organzational unit -> right click Jane doe -> select properties
					- Click "member of" tab -> Select Add -> type in domain admins -> Check Names -> OK -> Apply
- Log out of DC-1 as "labuser" and log back in as ‚Äúmydomain.com\jane_admin‚Äù

</p>
 
     

<h3>Step 5: Join Client-1 to your domain (mydomain.com)
</h3>

- Go back to the Azure portal. 
	- Go to Client-1 Virtual Machine
		- On the left hand side select Networking -> select the link next to the NIC -> DNS server -> Custom -> type in DC-1's private IP address -> Save
		- After it is done updating, select restart and select yes
- Log back into Client-1 using Microsoft Remote Desktop as original local admin (labuser)
	- Right click the start menu and select System
		- On right hand side, select Rename this PC (advanced) -> Change -> Under Member of, select domain -> type mydomain.com and select OK
			- Username: mydomain.com\jane_admin
			- Type in password and press OK
- Restart the computer

<h3>Step 6:  Setup Remote Desktop for non-adminitrative users on Client-1
</h3>

- Log back into Client-1 
	- use mydomain.com\jane_admin
		- Right click the start menu and select System
			- On the right hand side, select Remote Desktop -> under User Accounts, click on select users that can remotely access this PC -> Select add
			- Type: domain users -> Check Names -> OK. Select Ok again

</p>

<h3>Step 7:   Create a bunch of additional users and attempt to log into client-1 with one of the users
</h3>

- Log back into DC-1 as jane_admin
	- Search for Powershell_ise, right click on it and open as an administrator
		- At the top left, select new script and paste the contents of the script into it. You can find the script [here](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/AD_PS/blob/master/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1).
		- Click the green arrow button near the top middle to run the script
	- Once the users have been created, go back to Active Directory Users and Computers -> mydomain.com -> _EMPLOYEES
		- You will see all the accounts that were created, in here. 
- You can now log into Client-1 with one of the accounts that were created.
